For this project, I wanted to understand how young adult literature has changed over the past few years. I accessed the New York Times bestsellers API to gather the top books from 2013-2022. I then cross referenced all of the books returned to the OpenLibrary Database API to get the topics listed for each book. Using the data generated through this process, I created a Tableau visualization to help identify trends and look at the dataset from a few different perspectives. This site was created to display the visualization and to explain the importance of including diverse stories in YA literature.
