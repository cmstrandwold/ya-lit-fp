                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>
                        There are an estimated 10,000,000 adolescents and young-adults who identify as some form of
                        diverse person in the U.S.
                        However, only a small portion of young adult literature address these perspectives.
                        It is imperative that we recognize why it is important to expose all young adults to diverse
                        stories so that
                        we can all take steps to increasing our perspectives of the world.

                    <h3>The Danger of a Single Story</h3>

                    <div id="box1">
                        "What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face
                        of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters
                        were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have
                        foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify."
                        <p>- Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In her <a
                            href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story">Ted
                            Talk</a>, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie discusses her own personal experiences dealing
                        with seeing a lack of representation while growing up.
                        It affected her own ability to write her own stories-- when she first started she only
                        wrote about white protagonists because she thought people only wrote about foreigners and about
                        things with
                        which she could not personally identify. She also highlights how this lack of diversity impacts
                        non-minority readers. She coins the term "single-story", or the idea that if an individual
                        consumes
                        only one point of view, this can stunt their ability to develop a multi-dimensional view about a
                        group or culture. This can create and strengthen stereotypes, which can cause direct harm to
                        people in minority
                        communities.

                    </p>

                    <h3>Applying this on a Larger Scale</h3>
                    Creating self-identity between the ages of 12-24 is critical not only for oneself, but also as a
                    building block to create healthy and functional social
                    relationships once a person reaches adulthood. Because this is the key demographic for young adult
                    literature,
                    these books can be extra influential on this age group.
                    <div id="box1" style="height:250px">
                        "It is at this point that wider society becomes significant to the child by admitting him to
                        roles preparatory to the actuality of technology and economy. Where he finds out
                        immediately, however, that the color of his skin or the background of his parents rather
                        than his wish and will to learn are the factors that decide his worth as a pupil or
                        apprentice, the human propensity for feeling unworthy may be fatefully aggravated as a
                        determinant of character development."
                        <p>- Terri Moore-Porter </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>In her research, Terri Moore-Porter found that access to diverse stories was important not only
                        for minority students
                        but also for majority students as well. She found that the texts gave students a window into
                        other's experiences in a way
                        they may not find in their day-to-day lives. It allowed for self-reflection, and for students to
                        start to process their own
                        biases and assumptions. </p>
                    <p>
                        It is imperative that we start to increase the number of diverse books in our curriculum, and
                        that we encourage and
                        support authors in writing from unheard perspectives. If we are able to do this on a wider
                        scale, we can help growing students
                        feel seen and important in the world around them, and help others start to learn the value of
                        another perspective.
